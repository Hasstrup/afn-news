                                Just a few minutes after, Trump’s campaign announced legal action would follow.

He is a mess !” Trump also said in the tweet, his first public comment on Sims since he began promoting the book on different TV shows Monday.</span>
                                
                                <span class="large__indent">“Nice,“ Sims said on CNN’s “New Day,” where he was being interviewed when Trump’s tweet went out.</span>

                                <span class="large__indent">Just minutes earlier, CNN’s host Alisyn Camerota had asked Sims if he’d signed a non-disclosure agreement that may have barred him from sharing the kind of detailed, controversial information he put in his book.</span>
                                
                                <span class="large__indent">“The truth is I kinda don’t remember” Sims said laughing. “I assume I signed whatever Sean Spicer signed in the White House, I assume I signed whatever Corey Leandowski and Dave Bossie signed on the campaign those folks have written books. But I just don’t remember,” Sims said.</span>
                                
                                <span class="large__indent"> Within 20 minutes, both the president and the chief operating officer for Trumps campaign Michael Glassner had pointed out the NDA.
